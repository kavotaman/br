# Otávio Manzano Kavakama
Cellist, enjoys playing some crazy stuff. Favorite color is yellow. [Mesoclisis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mesoclisis) enthusiast.

In this website you will hopefully find the answers for all your questions.

If you are a composer, thank you for your work. If you are not a composer, consider becoming one and writing some crazy stuff. I love playing crazy stuff, especially if it's fresh (I like the smell of new music).

Anyway, feel free to hang out, [watch some videos](/media.html), [read some stuff](/blog/), [look at my bio](/about/bio.html), [etc.](/contact.html), [etc](/about/cv.html). 

Below you will encounter a cool image of my hometown of Atibaia, Brazil, and an image of my brother and I ready to record an awesome [music video](https://youtu.be/wCSFv_tt2NI). I hope you enjoy =)
